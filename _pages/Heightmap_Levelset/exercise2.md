  points: 1.5
  instructions: "Change the function and adjust the isolevel so that the levelset consists of a loop inside of another loop.  In 3D as a heightmap, a surface where such an isolevel exists is a volcano."
  goals:
    - Manipulate heightmaps for levelset curve editing
    - Work with implicit representations of curves

      feedback: "Try again: It looks like you have two loops, but you need to make sure one of them is inside of the other (hint: try subtracting one of the gaussians)"   
    - incorrectcheck: vs.length == 0
      feedback: "Try again: It looks like there are no contours in your image.  Please be sure to adjust the isolevel to find the correct height to generate the levelsets"
    - incorrectcheck: vs.length == 1
      feedback: "Try again: It looks like you only have one loop in your levelset.  Adjust the heightmap and choose a levelset so that there is one loop inside of another loop"
